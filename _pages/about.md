<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a third-year CS Master student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), advised by [Prof. Weinan Zhang](https://wnzhang.net). Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Inforamtion Engineering from SJTU in 2022.

Recently, my research works mainly focus on:
* Evaluation and analysis of LLMs.
* LLM with retrieval augmentation.
* LLM reasoning, planning, and rule-following.
* Interactive LLM agents.

Feel free to reach out if you are interested in my research or want to discuss with me.

**[arXiv preprint]** [RuleArena: A Benchmark for Rule-Guided Reasoning with LLMs in Real-World Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08972)

**Ruiwen Zhou**, Wenyue Hua, Liangming Pan, Sitao Cheng, Xiaobao Wu, En Yu, William Yang Wang

<strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- We create the <strong>RuleArena</strong> benchmark for LLM rule-guided reasoning, with a comprehensive set of 95 policies/rules drawn from real-world scenarios and 816 datapoints of different difficulty levels for LLM evaluation. We further propose a suite of evaluation metrics for both rule selection and rule application, providing fine-grained insights into LLM performances.
- Existing state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4o and Claude-3.5 Sonnet, mostly fail on complex rule-guided reasoning tasks from <strong>RuleArena</strong>. By examining common failure cases and identifying difficult rule types, we uncover several systematic issues that limit LLMs' rule-guided reasoning capabilities.

**[arXiv preprint]** [AntiLeak-Bench: Preventing Data Contamination by Automatically Constructing Benchmarks with Updated Real-World Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13670)

Xiaobao Wu, Liangming Pan, Yuxi Xie, **Ruiwen Zhou**, Shuai Zhao, Yubo Ma, Mingzhe Du, Rui Mao, Shuai Zhao, Anh Tuan Luu, William Yang Wang

<strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- We create the <strong>AntiLeak-Bench</strong> framework, which collects samples with explicitly new knowledge absent from LLMs' training sets, and thus ensures strictly contamination-free evaluation. This building workflow is also automated for maintainance and update without human labor.
- Experiments show that pre-cutoff samples come with data contamination, which inflates LLMs' performance, while contamination-free post-cutoff samples collected by our <strong>AntiLeak-Bench</strong> are more challenging and can more accurately assess LLMs.

**[SIGIR 2024]** [TRAD: Enhancing LLM Agents with Step-Wise Thought Retrieval and Aligned Decision](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.06221)

**Ruiwen Zhou**, Yingxuan Yang, Muning Wen, Ying Wen, Wenhao Wang, Chunling Xi, Guoqiang Xu, Yong Yu, Weinan Zhang

<strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- We propose a novel retrieval-augmented LLM agent **TRAD**. It achieves step-wise relevant demonstration selection via **thought retrieval (TR)**, and applies an **aligned decision (AD)** module to augment LLM with temporal neighboring steps and their corresponding order information of retrieved demonstrations during action prediction.
- **TRAD** significantly outperforms existing SoTA LLM agents such as Synapse and ReAct on common LLM agent benchmarks like ALFWorld (householding) and Mind2Web (web navigation).

**[arXiv preprint]** [Is Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning Properly Resolved?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.00547)

**Ruiwen Zhou**, Minghuan Liu, Kan Ren, Xufang Luo, Weinan Zhang, Dongsheng Li

<strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- We reveal the improper optimization in existing distributional risk-sensitive RL (RSRL) algorithms, showing that maximizing distortion risk measure at every step in a dynamic programming style leads to divergence.
- To address this issue, we propose a novel RSRL algorithm **Trajectory Q-Learning (TQL)**. By incorporating history return distribution, **TQL** achieves theoretical optimality and outperforms existing methods in RSRL tasks.

**[NeurIPS 2022]** [Learning Enhanced Representations for Tabular Data via Neighborhood Propagation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.06587)

Kounianhua Du, Weinan Zhang, **Ruiwen Zhou**, Yangkun Wang, Xilong Zhao, Jiarui Jin, Quan Gan, Zheng Zhang, David Wipf

<strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- We propose a GNN-based tabular prediction model **PET**. It considers both row-wise (across sample) and column-wise (across feature) feature interaction by transforming each target sample with retrieved relevant sample into a hypergraph and conducting message passing on it.
- On a wide range of tabular prediction tasks like CTR prediction and top-<em>n</em> recommendation, **PET** surpasses SoTA methods by a large margin.
