Hello! I am Ruiwen, a second-year CS master student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, currently also a visiting student at UC Santa Barbara. Under the supervision of Prof. [Weinan Zhang](https://wnzhang.net) at [APEX lab](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn) and [William Wang](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/), I conduct research about:
* Learning in environment with LLMs.
* Utilizing retrieval to enhance LLMs.
* Improving efficiency of LLMs.

In my spare time, I love:
* Listening to and playing music (I love pop. songs, musicals, piano, etc.).
* Thinking and discussing interesting (not only CS) problems.
* Going out for short walks on beautiful sites.

I have a strong interest in machine learning, and my ideal is to build a powerful agent, which can help to alleviate humans' working loads and spark humans' creative inspirations.

I am now seeking for a PhD opportunity (2025 fall) in US. If you are interested in communicating with me, feel free to contact me through [E-mail](mailto:skyriver@sjtu.edu.cn).
