Hi, my friend! I am Ruiwen, a first-year master student at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

In my spare time, I love:
* Listening to and playing music (I love classic and pop. music)
* Playing various ball sports, like basketball, badminton, etc.
* Playing electronic games, especially racing and moba ones
* Thinking and discussing machine learning problems

I have a strong interest in machine learning, and my ideal is to build a powerful agent, which can discover lots of patterns in massive data and help to alleviate humans' working loads.

At present I am a researcher advised by Prof. [Weinan Zhang](https://wnzhang.net) at [APEX lab](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn). If you are interested in communicating with me, feel free to contact me through [E-mail](mailto:skyriver@sjtu.edu.cn).
