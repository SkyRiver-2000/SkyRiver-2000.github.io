Hello! I am Ruiwen, a second-year master student at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Under the supervision of Prof. [Weinan Zhang](https://wnzhang.net) at [APEX lab](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn), I conduct research about:
* Learning from environment feedback with LLMs.
* Retrieval-augmented LLM agents.
* LLMs + X (music, control, etc.) applications.

In my spare time, I love:
* Listening to and playing music (I love pop. songs, musicals, piano, etc.)
* Thinking and discussing interesting problems
* Going out for short walks

I have a strong interest in machine learning, and my ideal is to build a powerful agent, which can help to alleviate humans' working loads and spark humans' creative inspirations.

I am now seeking for a summer research internship in 2024 and a PhD position (2025 fall). If you are interested in communicating with me, feel free to contact me through [E-mail](mailto:skyriver@sjtu.edu.cn).
