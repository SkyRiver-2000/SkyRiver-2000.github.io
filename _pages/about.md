Hi, my friend! I am Ruiwen, a junior undergraduate majoring in information engineering at SJTU, and a member of Zhiyuan Honor Program in Engineering.

In my spare time, I love:
* Listening to and playing music (I love classic and pop. music)
* Playing various ball sports, like basketball, badminton, etc.
* Playing electronic games, especially racing and moba ones
* Thinking and discussing machine learning problems

I have a strong interest in machine learning, and my ideal is to build a powerful agent, which can discover lots of patterns in massive data and help to alleviate humans' working loads.

At present I am an undergraduate researcher advised by Prof. [Weinan Zhang](https://wnzhang.net) at [APEX lab](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn), and I will join the department of CSE at SJTU as a master candidate by 2022 Fall. If you are interested in communicating with me, feel free to contact me through [E-mail](mailto:skyriver@sjtu.edu.cn).
