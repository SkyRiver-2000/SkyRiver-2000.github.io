Hello! I am Ruiwen Zhou, a second-year CS master student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, advised by Prof. [Weinan Zhang](https://wnzhang.net) at [APEX lab](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn). Currently I am also a visiting student at UCSB, advised by Prof. [William Yang Wang](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/).

My research interest lies in building powerful agents that can automatically complete complex real-world tasks and inspire creative ideas / designs for humans. To achieve this, recently I focus on two aspects of large language models (LLMs):
* LLM agents in interactive environments.
* Natural language reasoning with LLMs.

In my spare time, I love:
* Listening to and playing music (I love pop. songs, musicals, piano, etc.).
* Thinking and discussing interesting (not limited to AI/CS) problems.
* Going out for short journeys on beautiful sites.

**I am now seeking for a PhD opportunity (2025 fall) in US. If you are interested or have questions in my research works, feel free to contact me through [E-mail](mailto:skyriver@sjtu.edu.cn).**
