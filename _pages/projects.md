* **2021.05-2021.06: Data Mining and Predicting on *AceMap***

This is the final project for course *EE226*, *Big Data Mining (AI)*, in SJTU. We are required to conduct node classification and link prediction tasks on an academic citation network called *AceMap*. My group proposes simple and effective solutions and achieves an outstanding performance.

**Codes:** [click here](https://github.com/SkyRiver-2000/EE226-Final-Project) to visit our GitHub repository  
**Paper:** [click here](../files/EE226-report.pdf) for our solution paper

* **2020.05-2020.06: Imitation Learning for Control in 2048 Games**

This is the final project for course *EE228*, *Machine Learning (AI)*, in SJTU. We are required to train an agent with supervisions from the Expectimax, a powerful planning based agent, to achieve high scores in an 2048 game. I combine two convolution architectures into a novel one, fine tune the parameters, and obtain one of the most powerful agent in the class.

* **2021.03-2021.06: Batch Recognition of Book Labels on Mobile Devices**

This is the final project for course *EE225*, *Intelligent Internet of things*, in SJTU. We are required to build a real-time system to recognize the book labels and corresponding book numbers. We use a two-stage scheme: localize the book labels first, and then generate subfigures for optical character recognition (OCR). Our localization model is based on [NanoDet](https://github.com/RangiLyu/nanodet) and our OCR is based on [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).
