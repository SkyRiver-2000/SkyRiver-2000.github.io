collection: projects
permalink: /project/2020-05-2020-06-EE228
excerpt: 'This is the final project for course *EE228*, *Machine Learning (AI)*, in SJTU. We are required to train an agent with supervisions from the Expectimax, a powerful planning based agent, to achieve high scores in an 2048 game. I combine two convolution architectures into a novel one, fine tune the parameters, and obtain one of the most powerful agent in the class.'
